            <h2><a href="../index.html" class="sitenav">Pratik Ratadiya</a> > My Beliefs</h2>
            <p>Here are a few things I believe in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ingredients for success: Privilege, Hard work, Intelligence, Courage, Culture, Luck.</li>
                <li>Seldom expect, always accept.</li>
                <li>Follow your talent before you follow your passion.</li>
                <li>3 questions to check if everything is good:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When I go to bed, am I grateful for how the day went?</li>
                        <li>Am I sleeping well?</li>
                        <li>When I wake up, am I excited to work?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In this lifetime, this is the last time you will ever be as old as you are right now.</li>
                <li>3 Cs in visionaries: Convincing, Curious, Courageous.</li>
                <li>Read more than you watch. Listen more than you speak.</li>
                <li>Do at most 3 things at once: One which makes you happy, one which makes you rich, and one which makes you knowledgable. Ideally, you try to increase the overlap.</li>
                <li>Be kind with those below you. Be confident with those above you.</li>
                <li>Never drink alcohol. Never do drugs. Never kill something unless utmost necessary.</li>
            </ul>
