        <ul>
            <li><b>RAMAN: Robust Approaches for Multimodal ANomaly detection in Mars Rover Power Systems</b>, <i>AIAA SciTech 2024.</i></li>
            <i>Pratik Ratadiya, Ryan Alimo, Brian Kahovec, Farrokh Vatan, William Gilbert</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span>
            <p>Description: This paper described my work on improving the anomaly detection modules of the Mars Science Lab focusing on the power subsystems of the Mars rovers. I developed multiple approaches using methods like thresholding of derivative of error, autoencoder reconstruction error, and spline interpolation based on the signal types and data availability and packaged them all together as a single system.</p>

            <li><b>Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder for Document Classification</b>, <i>IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2021 - Workshop.</i></li>
            <i>Harsh Sakhrani, Saloni Parekh, Pratik Ratadiya</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology</span>
            <p>Description: I guided Harsh and Saloni in scoping their research on coming up with novel transformer-based architectures for document classification.</p>

            <li><b>Contextualized Embedding based Approaches for Social Media-specific Sentiment Analysis</b>, <i>IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2021 - Workshop.</i></li>
            <i>Harsh Sakhrani, Saloni Parekh, Pratik Ratadiya</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology</span>
            <p>Description: I guided Harsh and Saloni in scoping their research on coupling models like BERTweet with convolutional and transformer-based encoders for irony detection and emotion recognition from social media posts.</p>

            <li><b>Contextualized embeddings based convolutional neural networks for duplicate question identification</b>, <i>arXiv (preprint).</i></li>
            <i>Harsh Sakhrani, Saloni Parekh, Pratik Ratadiya</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: vCreaTek LLC</span>
            <p>Description: I guided Harsh and Saloni in scoping their research on how to use convolutional networks for getting embeddings that can in turn be used to compare two questions for checking potential duplication.</p>

            <li><b>Attestable at semeval-2021 task 9: extending statement verification with tables for unknown class, and semantic evidence finding</b>, <i>SemEval 2021</i></li>
            <i>Harshit Varma, Aadish Jain, Pratik Ratadiya, Abhishek Rathi</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: vCreaTek LLC</span>
            <p>Description: I was the manager of Harshit and Aadish for their winter internships where we participated in the SemTabFact task at SemEval 2021. Our team managed to be in the Top 8 leaderboard from more than 65 participating teams for both the statement verification and the evidence finding tasks, based on tabular data.</p>

            <li><b>A decentralized aggregation mechanism for training deep learning models using smart contract system for bank loan prediction</b>, <i>International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-PRICAI) 2020 - Workshop.</i></li>
            <i>Pratik Ratadiya, Khushi Asawa, Omkar Nikhal</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology.</span>
            <p>Description: I led a project on exploring vertical federated learning, where data is vertically split between nodes. Can a global neural network be trained on the aggregation of embeddings from local networks? We explored this idea in the context of bank loan prediction, where personal finances and health insurance data may not be available at the same place.</p>

            <li><b>An attention ensemble based approach for multilabel profanity detection</b>, <i>IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2019 - Workshop.</i></li>
            <i>Pratik Ratadiya, Deepak Mishra</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology.</span>
            <p>Description: This paper was an outcome of my summer research internship at IIST where I worked on detecting profanity to keep feedback systems cleaner. We evaluated the final attention-based ensemble architecture on the comment toxicity challenge on Kaggle and got a Top 1% leaderboard score.</p>

            <li><b>Multilingual cyber abuse detection using advanced transformer architecture</b>, <i>IEEE TENCON 2019.</i></li>
            <i>Aditya Malte, Pratik Ratadiya</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology.</span>
            <p>Description: We were one of the first to use BERT for multilingual hate speech detection. Modifying the Jupyter notebooks released by the Google Research team to get a BERT model running on Colab. Those were the days!</p>

            <li><b>Evolution of transfer learning in natural language processing</b>, <i>arXiv.</i></li>
            <i>Aditya Malte, Pratik Ratadiya</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology.</span>
            <p>Description: I thought the field of NLP was moving very rapidly in 2017-19 (LoL over this in 2024) and it was hard to keep up with all the architectures. So in our junior year, me and Aditya wrote a survey covering the most important transfer learning contributions in NLP. It was a surprising hit and stands at almost 60 citations with zero marketing! (and a terrible name in my opinion).</p>

            <li><b>Spam filtering on forums: A synthetic oversampling based approach for imbalanced data classification</b>, <i>arXiv.</i></li>
            <i>Pratik Ratadiya, Rahul Moorthy</i><br>
            <span>Affiliation: Pune Institute of Computer Technology.</span>
            <p>Description: Let's just call this a report of my work as a FOSSEE Summer fellow at IIT Bombay. Rahul helped me write it out as a paper, and we ended up giving a talk on our results at SciPy India 2018! Not bad for a sophomore :)</p>
