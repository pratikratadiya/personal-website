            <h2><a href="index.html" class="sitenav">Pratik Ratadiya</a> > Projects</h2>
            <p>Some projects I really enjoyed working on.</p>
        </div>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Model Hopper Parallelism</b> <i>Dask, Python</i></li>
                <i>Implementation of the Cerebro paper in Dask</i><br>
                <p>Description: Implemented Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP), a new distributed model training mechanism proposed in the Cerebro paper (VLDB 2020) using Dask. Achieved a 1.2x speedup when evaluated on the Criteo dataset. This project secured me the 1st rank in the CSE 234 course.</p>

                <li><b>Championship winning strategies for the Pokemon Video Game Championships</b> <i>C++, Theory</i></li>
                <i>Analysis of various dynamic programming algorithms</i><br>
                <p>Description: As a part of the CSE 202 Algorithms course, implemented a set of algorithms that can help a player select the best possible team of Pokemons from a given list, such that maximum offence and minimum weaknesses are maintained for winning the Video Game Championships (VGC).</p>

                <li><b>Federated learning for private medical AI</b> <i>PySyft, Python, PyTorch</i></li>
                <i>Proof-of-concept of horizontal federated learning</i><br>
                <p>Description: Worked on the use of Federated learning over structured and unstructured medical data to address data sharing issues in machine learning. We achieved a 98.8% retention in test results when data was decentralized over 8 nodes for the Pima Indians diabetes dataset. The project was sponsored by Persistent systems ltd.</p>

                <li><b>Modi 2.0: Political speech generator</b> <i>Python, Keras, Selenium</i></li>
                <i>Fine-tuning and inference using the GPT-2 model</i><br>
                <p>Description: Made use of the OpenAI GPT-2 model to generate political speeches in English as well as Hindi, similar in style to the ones delivered by the Prime minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi. Scraped over 100 speeches from his website using Selenium as fine-tuning data for this task.</p>
