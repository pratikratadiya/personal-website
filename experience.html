            <h2>Pratik Ratadiya: Work Experiences</h2>
            <p>A list of my work experiences in reverse chronological order.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b></li>
                <i>Visiting Researcher: Mission Control Systems Deep Learning Technologies</i><br>
                <span>Mar 2023 - August 2023</span>
                <p>Description: Responsible for developing a multimodal anomaly detection system for the power systems of the Mars rovers. The developed system was tested on 18 different signal types on over 62K data points. As a side project, I also implemented the <a href="https://pengsongyou.github.io/openscene" target="_blank">OpenScene</a> paper for 3D surface reconstruction to make question answering systems on 3D volume renders for Mars surfaces.</p>

                <li><b>Network Contagion Research Institute</b></li>
                <i>Graduate Research Fellow</i><br>
                <span>Nov 2022 - August 2023</span>
                <p>Description: Researched and developed new deep learning models for various social issues. Developed an incitement detection model with 85% accuracy for calls for violence given against Hindus and Muslims in <a href="https://networkcontagion.us/reports/11-16-22-cyber-social-swarming-precedes-real-world-riots-in-leicester-how-social-media-became-a-weapon-for-violence/">Leicester</a>. Created a new antisemitism detection dataset with 20K+ samples and fine-tuned a HateBERT model on it.</p>                

                <li><b>Apple Inc.</b></li>
                <i>Machine Learning Intern: Machine Intelligence - Machine Translation (Automation)</i><br>
                <span>June 2022 - Sept 2022</span>
                <p>Description: Researched and implemented BERT-based models for offensive and vulgar language detection. Improved the F1 score of existing systems by 15%. Accomplished end-to-end project work: Managing data annotation, training models, deploying REST APIs, and integration with current pipelines.</p>

                <li><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></li>
                <i>Data Scientist: Medical Instruments</i><br>
                <span>Jan 2022 - Aug 2022</span>
                <p>Description: Staffed by vCreaTek LLC with the responsibility of improving the price forecasting methods of the Medical Instruments Global Division of J&J. Implemented a scalable price forecasting algorithm capable of training 500K+ models for various product-market combinations using a single script. Decreased the MAE at platform-level price predictions by 35%.</p>


                <li><b>vCreaTek LLC</b></li>
                <i>Data Scientist: Machine Learning and Product</i><br>
                <span>Sept 2021 - Sept 2022</span>
                <p>Description: Responsible for improving the data science capabilities and software solution consulting of the company. Researched and led a team of 3 people to implement a table-based statement verification model that got a Top 8 worldwide position in the Sem-Tab-Fact task at SemEval 2021. Part of the five-member team at Frontdoor Inc. that developed the first version of their <a href="https://developer.frontdoorhome.com/">developer portal</a> using Golang.</p>
